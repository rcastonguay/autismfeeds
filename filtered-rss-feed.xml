      <title>Schools are failing children like mine | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/dec/17/schools-failing-children-like-mine-ofsted-attendance-letters</link>
      <description>The classroom is a hostile environment for my autistic son. No wonder so many pupils are skipping school&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Eva Wiseman for her compassionate article (“&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/dec/10/eva-wiseman-the-real-reason-why-schools-are-failing" title=""&gt;Schools today are failing – and it’s clear who needs detention&lt;/a&gt;”, Magazine). I disagree somewhat with Ofsted’s narrative about attendance. Numbers of those persistently absent have been increasing since the early 2010s and tend to happen at key-stage changes (years 1, 3, 7 and 10). This usually impacts those who are neurodiverse and have known special educational needs. Half of the pupils with persistent attendance issues experience difficulty with attendance by the age of seven. It’s convenient for Ofsted to blame parents and Covid, when actually this problem has been gradually increasing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an autistic son who has had no meaningful education for over two years. Parents like me end up going to court to beg for more support or get press-ganged into “electively home educating”. There is very little Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services support for the neurodivergent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/dec/17/schools-failing-children-like-mine-ofsted-attendance-letters"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Extra $25bn needed to make NDIS sustainable by boosting other disability services, actuary says</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/19/ndis-services-funding-government</link>

      <title>‘I have a bag on my head. Deal with it!’ Is Blindboy the perfect podcaster?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He wears plastic bags as an ‘autistic protest’ and makes podcasts about everything from fish fingers to the Baileys sex cult. The former Rubberbandit talks about turning his ‘weirdo’ world into millions of hits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood curiosity has genuinely never left me,” says Blindboy. “I’m curious about everything. All the time. Whatever it is, I’m always wanting to know: Why? How? What if?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ceaseless curiosity is what has made &lt;a href="https://play.acast.com/s/blindboy" title=""&gt;The Blindboy Podcast&lt;/a&gt; such a sensation in the world of audio. Written, recorded and produced by one man in Limerick and released once a week like clockwork, it regularly pulls up to a million listeners a month from around the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/12/i-have-a-bag-on-my-head-deal-with-it-is-blindboy-the-perfect-podcaster"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We equate verbal fluency with intelligence’: why Angie Kim wrote a novel about a non-speaking autistic boy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/27/nonverbal-people-deserve-a-voice-angie-kim-on-why-she-wrote-a-novel-about-a-boy-with-severe-autism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you can’t express yourself through speech? The writer&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on her new book and her own experience of being unable to communicate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost two decades ago, I went to a medical conference to learn about treatment options for my son’s ulcerative colitis. His doctor described an incident involving a non-speaking autistic teenage patient, who everyone assumed couldn’t understand anything. His parents were mystified and frustrated because his repetitive behaviours, including screaming and hitting his head against the wall, were out of control. As they were telling the doctor that his teachers were sure this was a purely behavioural issue, the boy grabbed his sister’s preschool alphabet toy and typed, &lt;em&gt;help&amp;nbsp;me it hurts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately teared up and couldn’t stop thinking about it. This is, of course, an emotional story that would affect any person. But it was acute for me, more personal, because of what I had gone through as an immigrant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/27/nonverbal-people-deserve-a-voice-angie-kim-on-why-she-wrote-a-novel-about-a-boy-with-severe-autism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marianna Spring dives into her inbox to investigate cases of online hate; a young autistic woman sectioned for three years tells her shocking story. Plus, Kenneth Tynan and the CIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do You Hate Me?&lt;/strong&gt; (Radio 4) | &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001vtl1"&gt;BBC Sounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient 11&lt;/strong&gt; | &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/patient-11-podcast-13054441"&gt;Sky News/Independent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory of Everything: Not All Propaganda Is Art&lt;/strong&gt; | &lt;a href="https://theoryofeverythingpodcast.com/2024/01/napia1/"&gt;theoryofeverythingpodcast.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC’s disinformation and social media correspondent, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/04/bbc-marianna-spring-violent-rhetoric-conspiracyland"&gt;Marianna Spring&lt;/a&gt;, is a woman for whom the words “sucker for punishment” were invented. Polite, cheerful, dedicated, she has spent the past few years tracking down online hooligans and conspiracy theorists in award-winning radio series such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0bpc91l"&gt;Death By Conspiracy?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001dpnp"&gt;Disaster Trolls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001mssl"&gt;Marianna &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001mssl"&gt;in Conspiracyland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a lonely and impressionable teenager became fixated on Islamic State, police began an operation that ended up further radicalising him. At just 14, the boy was then charged with terrorism offences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts and justice reporter &lt;strong&gt;Nino Bucci &lt;/strong&gt;tells &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Keneally &lt;/strong&gt;how and why police targeted the vulnerable teenager, and the questions the case raises about the authorities’ role in the deradicalisation process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can support the Guardian at &lt;a href="http://theguardian.com/fullstorysupport"&gt;theguardian.com/fullstorysupport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can subscribe for free to Guardian Australia’s daily &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story"&gt;news podcast Full Story&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story/id1482061243"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh"&gt; Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2F1c3RyYWxpYS1uZXdzL3Nlcmllcy9mdWxsLXN0b3J5L3BvZGNhc3QueG1s?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwjogPTcoIj_AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ&amp;amp;hl=en-AU"&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2024/feb/19/australia-police-autistic-teenager-islamic-state-fixation-operation-full-story-podcast"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on the special needs crisis: children don’t deserve this chaos | Editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-special-needs-crisis-children-dont-deserve-this-chaos</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By failing to adequately fund their own policy, ministers have created a destructive standoff between families, councils and schools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade after David Cameron’s coalition government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/feb/10/special-educational-needs-sen-reforms-five-things"&gt;overhauled provision&lt;/a&gt; for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England, it has never been clearer that the system is in crisis. A raft of measures designed to appeal to parents, by promising them greater influence over their children’s education, has resulted in a destructive standoff between families, schools and councils – because ministers failed to adequately fund their own policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the choices that were offered, parents of pupils who, for a range of reasons, are not thriving in mainstream classrooms, have been forced to fight for the resources that local authorities must provide to enable them to access education. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/26/children-put-at-risk-as-nhs-autism-assessments-are-cut-back"&gt;Long waiting times&lt;/a&gt; for NHS autism assessments, combined with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/18/hundreds-of-children-with-special-needs-wait-a-year-for-support-in-england"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; in issuing education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – the documents that set out children’s entitlements – mean that thousands of families are stuck. Even where plans have been agreed, there are many instances in which pupils do not receive the placement or support that they ought to guarantee. Families are left trapped, knowing that needs are not being met but unable to remedy what can turn into a damaging experience of exclusion from education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-special-needs-crisis-children-dont-deserve-this-chaos"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What’s behind the UK’s increase in autism diagnoses?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experts are undecided about whether there is overdiagnosis or whether more children are autistic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/some-nhs-centres-twice-as-likely-to-diagnose-adults-as-autistic-study-finds"&gt;Some NHS centres twice as likely to diagnose adults as autistic, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a condition in a state of slow flux. In &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;2021, a study&lt;/a&gt; found a 787% rise in the number of diagnoses between 1998 and 2018 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increases in diagnoses have been a feature of autism for almost as long as it has been a recognised condition: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467195/#:~:text=In%20the%20mid%2D1980s%2C%20researchers,%E2%80%9Cpre%2Depidemic%E2%80%9D%20period."&gt;80 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, autism was thought to affect one in 2,500&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;children. That has gradually increased and now &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00045-5/fulltext"&gt;one in 36 children&lt;/a&gt; are believed to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

To meet her eye when she talked to him and to be able to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All I wanted to do was be able to connect and bond with Fynn,” she said. “But when your baby looks everywhere else in the room except at you and stays in their own zone, like you’re completely unimportant to them, it’s upsetting in a way that I struggle to put into words.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/08/research-autism-evolving-transforming-lives-social-communication-therapy-drugs-trials"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doreen Worthington &lt;/strong&gt;says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a new Education Reform Act is needed and lists what an incoming government could do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autism crisis (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/05/autistic-pupils-in-england-denied-right-to-education-as-absenteeism-surges-says-charity"&gt;Autistic pupils in England denied right to education as absenteeism surges, says charity, 5 March&lt;/a&gt;) is the latest in a long list of crises in English schools that the Guardian has reported on recently, including the children’s mental health crisis, the teacher recruitment and retention crisis, the headteacher retention crisis, the absenteeism crisis, the Ofsted intimidation crisis, the crisis of children not being toilet trained or knowing how to brush their teeth, the literacy crisis, the maths crisis and now the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it not time that someone (a future Labour government perhaps) started to join the dots and realise that a new Education Reform Act is needed to rescue our children from this crisis in education? They could start with a snappy election slogan – “Education, education, education” for example – and a commitment to bringing back Sure Start centres, funding nursery and early years education properly, reversing almost all the Gove-era ideological changes to the curriculum and testing regimes, bringing back the arts, humanities, sport and extracurricular activities that schools can no longer afford or find time for, funding and reforming Send provision, investing properly in child and adolescent mental health services, abolishing Ofsted and replacing it with his majesty’s inspectors, introducing a fair salary system and, finally, abolishing multi-academy trusts and bringing all schools back under properly funded local education authority control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/mar/14/how-labour-could-rescue-children-from-this-endless-series-of-educational-crises"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Maybe everybody feels socially awkward’: the standups turning being autistic into a comedy superpower</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/16/autism-comedy-superpower-fern-brady-pierre-novellie-joe-wells-charlie-george</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Fern Brady to Hannah Gadsby, a host of comedians have discovered that they are autistic. What is it about standup that lends itself so well to neurodivergent people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Pierre Novellie was previewing an early version of&amp;nbsp; his standup show Why Can’t I&amp;nbsp;Just Enjoy Things? – things such as holidays and trips to the cinema (due to the “all the chewing and rustling packets”) – when he was interrupted by an audience member’s polite heckle. “He said: ‘You&amp;nbsp;sound like me,’” recalls Novellie. The&amp;nbsp;comedian asked what that meant. “He said: ‘I have Asperger’s – I think you have Asperger’s.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Novellie began seriously looking into the prospect that he was autistic (the term Asperger’s is no longer commonly used, partly because of its namesake’s Nazi affiliations, but&amp;nbsp;some autistic people still refer to it). He began taking multiple online tests, alternating between answering completely truthfully and “in the most normal, sociable way” he could, yet both approaches put him firmly above the threshold for autism. In 2022, he finally received a formal diagnosis – by&amp;nbsp;which point he’d realised that the title of Why Can’t I Just Enjoy Things? wasn’t rhetorical. “It turned out there was an answer: these were inherently autistic routines,” says Novellie (in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;case of rustling packets, sound sensitivity is common in autistic people). “So that became the ending of&amp;nbsp;the show.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/16/autism-comedy-superpower-fern-brady-pierre-novellie-joe-wells-charlie-george"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘A talented, goofy kid’: family of Ryan Gainer, autistic teen killed by police, speak out</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/21/ryan-gainer-autistic-teen-police-killing-california</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shooting of 15-year-old ‘beautiful soul’ in California revives scrutiny on law enforcement abuse of youth with disabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ryan Gainer was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, he was nonverbal, and his family all learned sign language to communicate with him. But after the southern California boy learned how to speak at around age four, he was a “ball of energy” who never stopped talking, his older sister Rachel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He loved saying “hi” to neighbors and strangers alike, and as a young teen was known as the student who greeted everyone with a “good morning” and a smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/21/ryan-gainer-autistic-teen-police-killing-california"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Platinum-selling singer songwriter Cat Burns cosies up with Grace for a warm plate of nosh and some deep chats. The biggest-selling British female artist of 2022, who won three Brit award nominations after her single Go went viral on TikTok, reveals how she went from shy schoolgirl to stadium gigs in just a few years. While Covid put an end to busking on the South Bank, it opened up another portal on social channels that sent Cat’s star on its rapid ascent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently diagnosed as autistic, Cat explains how her relationship with food thrives on predictability and consistency. Yet with a small recipe suggestion from her girlfriend, she had a lightbulb moment – opening up new possibilities. Cat says she doesn’t do small talk, which is more than OK; her big talk is just beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New episodes of Comfort Eating with Grace Dent will be released every Tuesday&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2024/mar/26/s6-ep-7-cat-burns-singer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Everybody has a breaking point’: how the climate crisis affects our brains</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/everybody-has-a-breaking-point-how-the-climate-crisis-affects-our-brains</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are growing rates of anxiety, depression, ADHD, PTSD, Alzheimer’s and motor neurone disease related to rising temperatures and other extreme environmental changes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late October 2012, a category 3 hurricane howled into New York City with a force that would etch &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/29/new-york-hurricane-sandy-climate-protest"&gt;its name into the annals of history&lt;/a&gt;. Superstorm Sandy transformed the city, inflicting more than $60bn in damage, killing dozens, and &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/downloads/pdf/final_report/Ch_1_SandyImpacts_FINAL_singles.pdf"&gt;forcing&lt;/a&gt; 6,500 patients to be evacuated from hospitals and nursing homes. Yet in the case of one cognitive neuroscientist, the storm presented, darkly, an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoko Nomura had found herself at the centre of a natural experiment. Prior to the hurricane’s unexpected visit, Nomura – who teaches in the psychology department at Queens College, CUNY, as well as in the psychiatry department of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai – had meticulously assembled a research cohort of hundreds of expectant New York mothers. Her investigation, the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/5/1388/2907773"&gt;Stress in Pregnancy study&lt;/a&gt;, had aimed since 2009 to explore the potential imprint of prenatal stress on the unborn. Drawing on the evolving field of epigenetics, Nomura had sought to understand the ways in which environmental stressors could spur changes in gene expression, the likes of which were already known to influence the risk of specific childhood neurobehavioural outcomes such as autism, schizophrenia and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/21/adhd-may-have-been-an-evolutionary-advantage-research-suggests"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/everybody-has-a-breaking-point-how-the-climate-crisis-affects-our-brains"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Strong Female Character by Fern Brady review – moving account of undiagnosed autism</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/29/strong-female-character-by-fern-brady-review-moving-account-of-undiagnosed-autism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Scottish comedian narrates her traumatic experience of being ‘wired differently’ and why autism is so frequently missed in women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Scottish comedian Fern Brady phoned her father to say she had been diagnosed with autism, he was on his daily commute back from London. He said, “Oh right”, and began complaining about the traffic. Brady replied: “Well, they say autism can be inherited from one parent, so I guess that’s answered the question of which one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong Female Character, written and narrated by Brady, and winner of the inaugural Nero award for nonfiction, documents the&amp;nbsp;turmoil of growing up with undiagnosed autism, during which she excelled academically but struggled with sensory overload and had violent outbursts that baffled her family, teachers and peers. After she began self-harming, her parents sent her to an adolescent psychiatric unit where she was a day patient. She was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, though she knew that wasn’t the whole story. It took until she was 34 to get an autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/29/strong-female-character-by-fern-brady-review-moving-account-of-undiagnosed-autism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
