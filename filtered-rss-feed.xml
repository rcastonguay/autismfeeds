      <description>When Ethan Hammerton was two and a half years old his mother Shanda wondered if she would ever hear her son say “mom” again. Shanda Hammerton had a normal pregnancy and Ethan was a healthy baby who developed normally until he was about 14 months old. At 26 months, Ethan had a screening and the family was told that “he is autistic.”</description>
