      <title>‘We were inundated’: creating pioneering homes for autistic young adults</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/10/we-were-inundated-creating-pioneering-homes-for-autistic-young-adults</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the success of Linden Farm, the Simon Trust helps families create specialised local residences for their adult children with highly complex needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents across the UK are forming partnerships with local councils to build pioneering supported-living homes for their autistic children with high needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With growing numbers of parents increasingly unable to find suitable, safe and secure residential accommodation for their young adult children – and cash-strapped councils having to pay exorbitant costs when already expensive placements break down – the two are coming together to forge a solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/10/we-were-inundated-creating-pioneering-homes-for-autistic-young-adults"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jason Arday: he learned to talk at 11 and read at 18 – then became Cambridge's youngest Black professor</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/jason-arday-cambridge-university-youngest-black-professor</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with autism as a child, Arday found his voice through speech therapy and his mother’s unflagging support. Now he is using it with the same tenacity that saw him run 30 marathons in 35 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Arday believes in destiny. The University of Cambridge’s youngest Black professor, he joined its faculty of education in March 2023, at 37. Before then, he had been a professor at Glasgow and Durham universities; published three books of academic work, mainly focusing on race and education; and, most importantly to him, raised more than £5m by doing charity work. All of this he has squeezed into a time period where he was learning to navigate the world with neurodivergence; Arday didn’t speak until he was 11 and couldn’t read or write until the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an unlikely story, he concedes, one that has made headlines and changed his life irrevocably. But he believes he was always going to do something great. “I knew I was destined to do something,” he says with a smile. “But I didn’t know it’d be this, admittedly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/11/jason-arday-cambridge-university-youngest-black-professor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>UK children waiting 16 months on average for ADHD and autism screening – study</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/uk-children-waiting-16-months-on-average-for-adhd-and-autism-screening-study</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive: Belfast has worst data, with typical wait of five years to be seen, against Nice guidance of 13-week maximum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with suspected ADHD and autism are waiting as long as seven years for treatment on the NHS, as the health service struggles to manage a surge in demand during a crisis in child mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said “inhumane” waits are putting a generation of neurodiverse children at risk of mental illness as they are “pushed to the back of a very long queue” for children and adolescent mental health services (Camhs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/uk-children-waiting-16-months-on-average-for-adhd-and-autism-screening-study"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Autism could be seen as part of personality for some diagnosed, experts say</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/autism-could-be-seen-as-part-of-personality-for-some-diagnosed-experts-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autism without intellectual disabilities could be reframed as human ‘variability’ rather than medical condition, says sociologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/adults-finally-diagnosed-autism-adhd"&gt;‘I recognised myself for the first time’: the adults finally diagnosed as autistic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a seven-fold rise in diagnoses of autism in the past 20 years in the UK, studies showing one in 36 children could be on the spectrum and waiting lists for help and support at record highs, awareness of neurodiversity has never been so high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, key voices are arguing that some autistic people could no longer be considered as having a disability at all. Instead, their autism could be regarded as part of their personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/autism-could-be-seen-as-part-of-personality-for-some-diagnosed-experts-say"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Antoinette Monks was diagnosed with autism and ADHD at 71, while Debra Brisch got her diagnosis at 68.

      <title>School phone ban would hit autistic children the hardest | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Barring smartphones from schools – as proposed by the UN – could leave autistic pupils feeling lost and overwhelmed, warns &lt;strong&gt;Carrie Myshkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t grow up with a smartphone at school. I’m 36. I had to make do with portable CD players and books. Nowadays, my phone is a vital part of my life. As an autistic person, it helps me play music and meditate, and generally shut out some of the overwhelmingness of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have helped me so much, had it been available to me when I was at school. I can read and listen to books on my phone, both of which would, again, have been massively helpful to me at school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Smartphones aren’t the answer for all autistic people | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/smartphones-arent-the-answer-for-all-autistic-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elaine Bennett&lt;/strong&gt; believes the increasing use of technology is only serving to further isolate some people in a neurotypical world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your correspondent (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest" title=""&gt;Letters, 3 August&lt;/a&gt;) that a ban on mobile phones in schools will impact pupils with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) negatively. People with ASD are already at risk of being pushed away from contact with other people and offered technology as an answer to every need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have ASD and I’m increasingly finding that the answers to any difficulties I have are all technological ones, often involving a smartphone that I don’t have. Having ASD does not equate to preferring to not speak to other humans. I feel that technology is being used as another way to silo people out of a neurotypical world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/smartphones-arent-the-answer-for-all-autistic-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wired differently: how neurodiversity adds new skillsets to the workplace</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/25/wired-differently-how-neurodiversity-adds-new-skillsets-to-the-workplace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the arts to the law, employers are seeing conditions such as autism and ADHD can have more benefits than drawbacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of his years as an actor and theatre-maker, Adam Welsh did not know he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neither did his agent, nor anyone he worked with. But since being diagnosed at the age of 34, he has realised the impact ADHD had on his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just found myself repeatedly in situations where employers wanted to let me go because of my behaviour,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/25/wired-differently-how-neurodiversity-adds-new-skillsets-to-the-workplace"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>No sleep, meltdowns and Billie Eilish: my first music festival as an autistic person</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/29/billie-eilish-reading-festival-as-an-autistic-person</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took the plunge at this year’s Reading festival, where sensory overload and mobility issues posed problems. Could I make it to the headline acts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my teenage years, I’ve always wanted to attend a music festival. But as an autistic person, the thought of being crammed into a loud, rowdy crowd of tens of thousands of people has always scared me. For years I avoided them. Instead, I would watch my friends enjoy themselves at big festivals from the sidelines of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after experiencing a bad breakup in January and adopting a mindset of trying new things, I decided to take the plunge and go to this year’s Reading festival with my friend. This decision to leave my comfort zone was made easier by a quick Google search revealing that Reading festival offers a range of disabled access services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/29/billie-eilish-reading-festival-as-an-autistic-person"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Children are holding a mirror up to us’: why are England’s kids refusing to go to school?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/02/children-are-holding-a-mirror-up-to-us-why-are-britains-kids-refusing-to-go-to-school</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many, lockdown was a relief. Some never went back at all. As a new academic year begins, more children than ever are worried about returning. What’s being done to get them into the classroom – and is that always the best idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millie was seven years old when she started struggling with going to school. Her teachers weren’t too worried initially, her mother, Sarah, says: she was managing fine academically. But Millie, who is autistic and has a sensory processing disorder, seemed to find the busy classroom overwhelming. The following year, she began seriously to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would start the night before,” says Sarah, a children’s nurse. “She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat her dinner, then in the morning she’d be absolutely flat out – it was taking an hour to get her out of bed. I would have to dress her, she’d be like a rag doll. And all the time they kept saying, ‘Just get her in, she’s fine once she’s in.’ It got to the point where I was physically unable to carry her, she’d be lying on the floor kicking and screaming.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/02/children-are-holding-a-mirror-up-to-us-why-are-britains-kids-refusing-to-go-to-school"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Penelope My Love review – admirably honest portrait of a mother and her autistic child</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Film-maker Claire Doyon’s bio-doc charts the rich but deeply challenging experiences of being a parent to daughter Pénélope and the intense bond that changes as they both grow older&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, French film-maker Claire Doyon made &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356424/"&gt;Pénélope&lt;/a&gt;, a 50-minute documentary, about taking her autistic daughter Pénélope to deepest Mongolia to meet a shaman. As a parent of children with autism, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/04/autism-best-film-portraits"&gt;I made it a mission to watch as many films as I could&lt;/a&gt; about the condition, and this unfortunately appears to have slipped through the net and is not available anywhere, at least in the UK or US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That elusiveness alone might suggest that Doyon’s own feelings about the film, her daughter and her quest to find ways to cope with Pénélope’s condition have changed over the years. What’s more, she has now made another film, Penelope My Love, which incorporates footage from her earlier work, forming what feels more like a revision than a mere revisiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/penelope-my-love-review-admirably-honest-portrait-of-a-mother-and-her-autistic-child"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Making room for neurodiversity in law: Why law firms would benefit from following a more flexible hiring process.</title>
      <link>https://nationalmagazine.ca/en-ca/articles/the-practice/workplace/2023/making-room-for-neurodiversity-in-in-law</link>
      <description>Simon Margolis knew he wanted to be a lawyer. He enjoys writing, tackling conceptual problems, and diving into minutia. But psychologists told his parents he should focus on computer science instead – because Margolis is autistic. “People were saying I was bad with social skills, so ‘he should work with computers,’ but that’s not how it works,” says Margolis, a knowledge management lawyer at BLG. “We need to have more dialogue with neurodiverse people who are adults.” The University of Victoria Faculty of Law hopes to start the conversation about supporting neurodivergent people in the legal profession. This fall, the Access to Justice Centre for Excellence (ACE) launched the Canada Neurodiversity in Law project, an advocacy program.”</description>
