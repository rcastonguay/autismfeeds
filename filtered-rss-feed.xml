      <title>‘I recognised myself for the first time’: the adults finally diagnosed as autistic</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/adults-finally-diagnosed-autism-adhd</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Antoinette Monks was diagnosed with autism and ADHD at 71, while Debra Brisch got her diagnosis at 68. Both say it was life-changing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/autism-could-be-seen-as-part-of-personality-for-some-diagnosed-experts-say"&gt;Autism could be seen as part of personality for some diagnosed, experts say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antoinette Monks was diagnosed with autism and probable inattentive ADHD last year, at 71 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have always known that I was different and always let everyone down but I didn’t know why,” she said. “That ‘not knowing why’ has haunted me throughout my life but it seemed impossible that I would ever find out why I behaved as I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/31/adults-finally-diagnosed-autism-adhd"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>School phone ban would hit autistic children the hardest | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Barring smartphones from schools – as proposed by the UN – could leave autistic pupils feeling lost and overwhelmed, warns &lt;strong&gt;Carrie Myshkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t grow up with a smartphone at school. I’m 36. I had to make do with portable CD players and books. Nowadays, my phone is a vital part of my life. As an autistic person, it helps me play music and meditate, and generally shut out some of the overwhelmingness of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have helped me so much, had it been available to me when I was at school. I can read and listen to books on my phone, both of which would, again, have been massively helpful to me at school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Smartphones aren’t the answer for all autistic people | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/smartphones-arent-the-answer-for-all-autistic-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elaine Bennett&lt;/strong&gt; believes the increasing use of technology is only serving to further isolate some people in a neurotypical world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your correspondent (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/03/school-phone-ban-would-hit-autistic-children-the-hardest" title=""&gt;Letters, 3 August&lt;/a&gt;) that a ban on mobile phones in schools will impact pupils with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) negatively. People with ASD are already at risk of being pushed away from contact with other people and offered technology as an answer to every need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have ASD and I’m increasingly finding that the answers to any difficulties I have are all technological ones, often involving a smartphone that I don’t have. Having ASD does not equate to preferring to not speak to other humans. I feel that technology is being used as another way to silo people out of a neurotypical world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/06/smartphones-arent-the-answer-for-all-autistic-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wired differently: how neurodiversity adds new skillsets to the workplace</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/25/wired-differently-how-neurodiversity-adds-new-skillsets-to-the-workplace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the arts to the law, employers are seeing conditions such as autism and ADHD can have more benefits than drawbacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of his years as an actor and theatre-maker, Adam Welsh did not know he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neither did his agent, nor anyone he worked with. But since being diagnosed at the age of 34, he has realised the impact ADHD had on his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just found myself repeatedly in situations where employers wanted to let me go because of my behaviour,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/aug/25/wired-differently-how-neurodiversity-adds-new-skillsets-to-the-workplace"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>No sleep, meltdowns and Billie Eilish: my first music festival as an autistic person</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/29/billie-eilish-reading-festival-as-an-autistic-person</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took the plunge at this year’s Reading festival, where sensory overload and mobility issues posed problems. Could I make it to the headline acts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my teenage years, I’ve always wanted to attend a music festival. But as an autistic person, the thought of being crammed into a loud, rowdy crowd of tens of thousands of people has always scared me. For years I avoided them. Instead, I would watch my friends enjoy themselves at big festivals from the sidelines of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after experiencing a bad breakup in January and adopting a mindset of trying new things, I decided to take the plunge and go to this year’s Reading festival with my friend. This decision to leave my comfort zone was made easier by a quick Google search revealing that Reading festival offers a range of disabled access services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/29/billie-eilish-reading-festival-as-an-autistic-person"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Children are holding a mirror up to us’: why are England’s kids refusing to go to school?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/02/children-are-holding-a-mirror-up-to-us-why-are-britains-kids-refusing-to-go-to-school</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many, lockdown was a relief. Some never went back at all. As a new academic year begins, more children than ever are worried about returning. What’s being done to get them into the classroom – and is that always the best idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millie was seven years old when she started struggling with going to school. Her teachers weren’t too worried initially, her mother, Sarah, says: she was managing fine academically. But Millie, who is autistic and has a sensory processing disorder, seemed to find the busy classroom overwhelming. The following year, she began seriously to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would start the night before,” says Sarah, a children’s nurse. “She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat her dinner, then in the morning she’d be absolutely flat out – it was taking an hour to get her out of bed. I would have to dress her, she’d be like a rag doll. And all the time they kept saying, ‘Just get her in, she’s fine once she’s in.’ It got to the point where I was physically unable to carry her, she’d be lying on the floor kicking and screaming.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/sep/02/children-are-holding-a-mirror-up-to-us-why-are-britains-kids-refusing-to-go-to-school"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Penelope My Love review – admirably honest portrait of a mother and her autistic child</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/penelope-my-love-review-admirably-honest-portrait-of-a-mother-and-her-autistic-child</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Film-maker Claire Doyon’s bio-doc charts the rich but deeply challenging experiences of being a parent to daughter Pénélope and the intense bond that changes as they both grow older&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, French film-maker Claire Doyon made &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356424/"&gt;Pénélope&lt;/a&gt;, a 50-minute documentary, about taking her autistic daughter Pénélope to deepest Mongolia to meet a shaman. As a parent of children with autism, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/04/autism-best-film-portraits"&gt;I made it a mission to watch as many films as I could&lt;/a&gt; about the condition, and this unfortunately appears to have slipped through the net and is not available anywhere, at least in the UK or US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That elusiveness alone might suggest that Doyon’s own feelings about the film, her daughter and her quest to find ways to cope with Pénélope’s condition have changed over the years. What’s more, she has now made another film, Penelope My Love, which incorporates footage from her earlier work, forming what feels more like a revision than a mere revisiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/13/penelope-my-love-review-admirably-honest-portrait-of-a-mother-and-her-autistic-child"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cruel and irresponsible myths about the NDIS are treating autistic Australians as villains. This must stop | Clem Bastow and Ali Schnabel</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/autistic-australians-must-stop-being-treated-as-villains-in-cruel-and-irresponsible-myths-about-the-ndis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Narratives about the so-called ‘epidemic’ of autism typically do not make the distinction between autistic people and diagnoses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people and those who support them know one thing to be true: wait long enough and we’ll be back in the news again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, an internal review paper suggested that NDIS funding could be “incentivising” families to seek autism diagnoses for their children. The paper was widely reported upon in Australian media but, by the time it was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/22/disability-advocate-hits-back-at-misleading-claims-that-ndis-funding-is-incentivising-autism-diagnoses"&gt;criticised by disability advocates&lt;/a&gt;, a particularly cruel narrative about autistic people had once again reared its head. As an autistic person, and a psychologist who works to support them, we are troubled by the often irresponsible reporting regarding autism and the NDIS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/autistic-australians-must-stop-being-treated-as-villains-in-cruel-and-irresponsible-myths-about-the-ndis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The new Tory austerity will be like nothing we've seen before. Here is its human cost | Frances Ryan</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/08/tory-austerity-jeremy-hunt-cuts-public-services</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt’s planned cuts will mean the death of public services. The lives of Britain’s most vulnerable people are on the line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vicky forgets to buy food, she doesn’t eat. Autism means she often can’t manage day-to-day tasks: from cleaning the house and remembering to wash to doing the weekly shop. “I can’t cope with being outside for any real length of time,” she says. “And sometimes it can take me four days to complete one online shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her medication goes the same way. When Vicky doesn’t order her antidepressants, she can’t sleep. Without her painkillers for her arthritis, she struggles to move. Rising bills on top of low benefits have only added to the distress. Vicky is now £1,600 in debt to her energy company, but her disability means she can’t call them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was amended on 8 December 2023 to remove a reference to libraries being a “discretionary” service; they are a statutory requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK and Ireland, &lt;a href="https://www.samaritans.org/"&gt;Samaritans&lt;/a&gt; can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email &lt;a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org"&gt;jo@samaritans.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie"&gt;jo@samaritans.ie&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Schools are failing children like mine | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/dec/17/schools-failing-children-like-mine-ofsted-attendance-letters</link>
      <description>The classroom is a hostile environment for my autistic son. No wonder so many pupils are skipping school&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Eva Wiseman for her compassionate article (“&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/dec/10/eva-wiseman-the-real-reason-why-schools-are-failing" title=""&gt;Schools today are failing – and it’s clear who needs detention&lt;/a&gt;”, Magazine). I disagree somewhat with Ofsted’s narrative about attendance. Numbers of those persistently absent have been increasing since the early 2010s and tend to happen at key-stage changes (years 1, 3, 7 and 10). This usually impacts those who are neurodiverse and have known special educational needs. Half of the pupils with persistent attendance issues experience difficulty with attendance by the age of seven. It’s convenient for Ofsted to blame parents and Covid, when actually this problem has been gradually increasing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an autistic son who has had no meaningful education for over two years. Parents like me end up going to court to beg for more support or get press-ganged into “electively home educating”. There is very little Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services support for the neurodivergent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/dec/17/schools-failing-children-like-mine-ofsted-attendance-letters"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
