# autismfeeds
This is a simple system that allows you to plug in multiple RSS feeds in a python script (feed-create.py) to combine them into one feed (filtered-rss-feed.xml). 
The repo also uses a GH workflow/action (yaml file under .github/workflows) to run the script on schedule and load up the needed requirements (python libraries referenced in requirements.txt)
